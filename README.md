This repository contains my implementations of various simple projects and programs. Each project is designed to showcase my programming skills and understanding of different concepts. Below is a brief overview of the projects included in this repository:

Number Guessing Game A classic number guessing game where the computer selects a random number and the player has to guess it within a certain range. The game provides feedback to help the player narrow down their guesses.

Simple Calculator An implementation of a basic calculator that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. It provides a command-line interface for users to input their calculations.

Student Grading System This project simulates a student grading system. It allows users to input student information and their respective grades. The system then calculates average scores and assigns grades based on predefined criteria.

Word Count This program reads a text file and calculates the total number of words in the text. While it counts the total word occurrences, it doesn't calculate the frequency of each unique word.

Movie Ticket Booking System This project models a simple movie ticket booking system. It allows users to browse available movies, select showtimes, and book tickets. It also keeps track of the seating arrangement in the theater.

Each project is contained within its respective directory in this repository. You can find detailed information, instructions, and the source code for each project in their respective folders. Feel free to explore, learn, and provide feedback!

Please note that these projects are for educational and demonstration purposes. They may not cover all edge cases or be production-ready, but they serve as a way for me to practice and showcase my programming skills.

If you have any questions, suggestions, or improvements, please feel free to open an issue or reach out to me. Thank you for visiting my repository!
